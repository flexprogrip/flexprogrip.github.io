      <h2>FlexPro Grip, LLC Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><strong>FlexPro Grip, LLC Privacy Policy</strong></p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy discloses the practices of FlexPro Grip LLC (“FPG”) concerning information we obtain by and through your use of the FPG Baseball website (the “Site”) or the FPG Mobile Application (the “Product”) and the services provided through either the Site or the Product (the “Services”).  FPG is committed to respecting your privacy and protection and management of Personally Identifiable Information you share with us. The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain the types of information FPG obtains about visitors to our Site and users of our Product and Services, how the information is obtained and used, the choices you have regarding our use of the information, and your ability to review and edit your choices regarding this information.   By using the Site, Product, or Services, you are accepting and consenting to this Privacy Policy in its entirety and the Terms and Conditions of Participation and Liability Waiver (all located on the FPG website). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Terms and Conditions of Participation. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy in its entirety, you should not use the FPG Site, Product, or Services.</p>      

      <p><strong>What Information We Collect</strong></p>
      <p>The information we collect on our Site and through your use of our Product or Services generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. If we combine Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

      <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
      <p>Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. The Personally Identifiable Information we collect may include: your name, date of birth, e-mail address, login name, passwords, etc. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you register on the Site or through the Product.</p>

      <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
      <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. The non-personally identifiable data we collect when you visit our Site may include: the browser you use to access our Site, the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the Web site that you came from before visiting our Site, the pages you visit on our Site, the URL you go to when you leave our Site, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and any search terms you enter while on our Site.</p>
      <p>We also may collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information in the form of statistics and information regarding the Product user’s statistics, which may be combined with personal information you submit through the Product. We may request additional information as part of your profile such as your weight, gender, handedness (right or left), prior injury history, throwing velocity, team name, etc.</p>
      <p>Your use of the Product may also include collection of information from your mobile device. For example, the FPG mobile application may request your permission to collect location data.  It is not essential for you to provide us with location data, so if you do not want to share your location data with FPG, please respond accordingly when prompted on your mobile device, or visit your mobile device settings. </p>

      <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
      <p>Our Site uses or may use “cookies” to gather Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  We use cookies to store information about your preferences and activity during and after your visit to a web site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept certain cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, there may be some features of our Site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly. By using the Site and/or Product, you consent to FPG’s use of cookies.</p>

      <p><strong>Why We Collect Information About You</strong></p>
      <p>Our primary goals in collecting information from and about you are to:
        <ol>
          <li>provide you with all the features and functions of the Site and the Product,</li>
          <li>communicate with you regarding our Site and Product,</li>
          <li>personalize your experience when you use our Site and Product.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>We may also use Non-Personally Identifiable Information on an aggregated and anonymous basis to understand how visitors use our Site and/or Product. We use this information to gather statistical information, improve the content of our Site, make our Site easier to use, and customize our advertising (but we will not provide Personally Identifiable Information to advertisers).</p>
      <p>We may also use information relating to use of the Site, Service and Product on an anonymous and aggregate basis for research purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, and to develop new designs and protocols.  When your information is used for such purposes, it will be used anonymously and will not be tied to your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

      <p><strong>How We Collect Information</strong></p>
      <p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information only when you provide it to us. If you do not want your Personally Identifiable Information to be used or collected, please do not submit it to us. There may be times, such as when a User registers through the Site and/or Product and/or signs up for any other product or service we may offer through the Site or the Product, at which we will ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, e-mail address, gender, etc. It will be totally up to you to decide if you are willing to provide us with this information.  But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to use certain services and content on our Site, or that may be available by using the Product.</p>
      <p>Our Site and Product may automatically collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including the web page from which you enter our Site, which web pages you visit, and how much time you spend on each page. Your mobile device may also collect certain information, if permitted by you, including geolocation data.</p>

      <p><strong>How We Use Information About You</strong></p>
      <p>Our primary use of your information is to provide you with Services through the Site and the Product. Your information (for example, your username and various metrics for activities) may be shared with other Users of the Product or Site with whom you choose to share information (for example, a teammate, friend, or coach). You can update your preferences regarding the sharing of your information at any time by accessing your Profile on the Site. </p>
      <p>We may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to develop new product ideas, for research, marketing, and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with third parties on an aggregate and anonymous basis.</p>
      <p>We may also use the information you provide us if you need customer service or technical support.</p>

      <p><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>
      <p>We use reasonable safeguards to protect Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.   Because no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, even though we will try to make reasonable efforts to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In the unlikely event of a data breach, you will be notified as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
      <p>We urge you to keep any password for use of the Service and/or Site confidential and not to disclose it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you leave our Site.</p>

      <p><strong>How to Correct or Remove Personal Information</strong></p>
      <p>If you do not want us to collect or store your Personally Identifiable Information, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted personal information and would like us to correct or remove your information from our records, please contact info@flexprogrip.com.</p>

      <p><strong>Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act</strong></p>
